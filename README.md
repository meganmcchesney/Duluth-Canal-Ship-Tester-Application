Duluth-Canal-Ship-Tester-Application
====================================

Structured permutations for determining an algorithm to sort ships that will use Duluth Canal

This application supports development of Duluth Canal Mobile Application by Saturn Systems Software Engineering. 

Ship Tester will create a csv of permutation of ship and port positions with static, created AIS data. The project was used to help determine an algorithm for sorting ships that will use the Duluth Canal.
